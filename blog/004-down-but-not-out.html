        It’s been a while since I’ve checked in here.
        I think part of the reason I started writing this blog is that I wanted to hold myself publicly accountable.
        Failure is something I am absolutely terrified of, but public failure is unthinkable for me.
        I certainly have not failed yet, but I was on track to do so.
        I’ve only run a little over 40 miles in the past two months.
        Part of this was out of my control, but I can do better.
        I was down, but I am definitely not out yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        February sucked.
        I developed a case of Plantar Fasciitis and initially tried to power through it, which any seasoned runner will tell you is a terrible idea.
        After a few days of my feet getting progressively worse, I made the smart decision and gave in.
        This was not a fun injury.
        It took until mid March for me to fully recover.
        Despite this injury, I ran the Hot Dash 10 mile on March 18th and <a href="http://www.mtecresults.com/runner/show?race=4936&rid=1488" target="_blank">got a personal best by about six and a half minutes</a>!
      </p>
      <p>
        I have no excuse for the rest of March.
        I ran once between the Hot Dash and my next speed bump.
        I am not proud of that, but it is what it is.
        I see my mistake and I know I can’t afford to do that again if I want to succeed this fall.
      </p>

        Since the beginning of April I have been plagued by this awful sickness.
        Even as I write this, my throat and voice are not 100%, although I am getting close.
        I was hoping this would be a two or three day illness, but I have had no such luck.
      </p>
      <p>
        So here we are.
        It is April 10th and I need to get back on the wagon.
        Tonight I was tired, I ate too much for dinner, and I had work that needed to get done.
        Lots of excuses that would have flown before, but not any more.
        So tonight, despite rain, sleet, and snow, (seriously) I ran the 4.8 miles scheduled in my marathon training program.
        It was supposed to be a slow, easy run based on my past race performances.
        That was not the case.
        It was awful, but it needed to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quitting is so easy.
        Starting again is hard.
        This time it was <strong>really</strong> hard.
        Some of the obstacles were out of my control, but others were just me being lazy and making excuses.
        I am back at it.
        I’ve officially started on my marathon training program.
        I will not fail.
