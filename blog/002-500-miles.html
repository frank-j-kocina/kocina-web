                I’m not usually one to take too much stock in New Year’s Resolutions, but this year was different.
                I made a bunch of them because I want to become a better person in all aspects of my life.
                One of them is to run 500 or more miles this year.
                I was going to shoot for 1000, and I may even hit that, but I wanted my goal to be something attainable and make sure I did not get discouraged or give up on it.
                I wanted to write this sooner, but life always seems to be busy, so at least I am getting this finished before February!
            </p>

                I started running just over a year ago and it has become a big part of my life.
                I had tried running before, but always hated it.
                I wasn’t a “real runner” so I felt weird running outside and could not stand the mind-numbing boredom of trotting along on a treadmill for even 30 minutes.
                Nonetheless, I decided I was going to become a real runner just over a year ago.
                I bought two cheap pairs of trail running shoes (hopefully I’d have better traction on the snow and ice) off of Amazon and got to it.

                I ran for a half mile, walked a bit, ran a quarter mile, walked some more, and kept this up until I had gone two miles.
                I did this almost every night and it was awful, but I was getting better.
                Eventually I could run a full two miles in less than 25 minutes.
                I still hated running, but I was losing weight, so I kept at it.
                One day at lunch a colleague of mine told me I was doing it all wrong.
                His exact words were, “You need to go slow to go fast.”
                That night I went out for another miserable run, but I really took his words to heart and had my best run yet.
                It was super slow, but I went twice as far as I had ever gone before - four miles!
                I even felt like I could keep going when I got home.
            </p>

                Over a year has gone by and I have stuck with it.
                I ran the TC 10 Mile in <a href="http://www.mtecresults.com/runner/show?race=4484&rid=31479" target="_blank">1:42:27</a> this past Fall and am hoping to do a lot more races in the future.
                I won’t say I love running, but I certainly don’t mind it, and even kind of like it if I’m in the right mood.
                I am in the best shape I have been in for the past ten years and it feels great.
                I bought two new pairs of “real” running shoes today from <a href="http://rivervalleyrunning.com/">River Valley Running</a> (awesome store!) and am excited to to keep going.
                I am signed up for the Hot Dash 10 Mile race in March and if my training keeps going well, I hope to do the TC Marathon this Fall.
            </p>

                I am well on my way to achieving my goal of 500 miles this year.
                I have run 34.2 miles so far, which puts me on track for about 594 miles.
                I think I should be further along than I am, but it has been a cold January and I’d prefer not to have a frostbitten face.
                Since I was crunched for time today, I went on a very quick run.
                2.3 miles in 17:57, or about a 7:50/mile pace.
                Pretty good improvement over a year ago!
                Thanks for reading, and here’s hoping that I rack up a ton of mileage in the next few months and stay injury free!
