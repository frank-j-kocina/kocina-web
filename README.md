# Personal Website of Frank J Kocina





## Overview

This site is statically hosted on AWS using S3 as a file store, CloudFront as a CDN, and Route53 for DNS.
The SSL certificate is created with LetsEncrypt and installed via IAM.





## SSL Setup and Renewal

Currently, SSL certificates generated by LetsEncrypt are valid for 90 days or less if they are revoked manually.
Therefore, it is recommended to renew SSL certificates every 60 days.
A complete guide to setup and renewal can be found below.

1. Run `brew install letsencrypt` if you do not have `letsencrypt` installed on your machine.
2. Run `letsencrypt certonly --manual --debug -d kocina.io` to begin the process of generating a certificate.
3. a. When you are prompted to prove ownership of the website, upload a file to S3 with the specified path and contents.

   b. Make sure the file is set to public the content type is set to `text/html`.
4. Continue the certificate generation process.
5. Once you've gotten your certificate, use the IAM user, `ssl-manager`, to install it with the command: `sudo aws iam upload-server-certificate --server-certificate-name cert_kocina_io --certificate-body file:///path/to/cert.pem --private-key file:///path/to/privkey.pem --certificate-chain file:///path/to/chain.pem --path /cloudfront/certs/`.

<small>Note: I had issues with installing `letsencrypt`. May need to pull from GitHub and use `letsencrypt-auto`.</small>





## Roadmap Initiatives

* Set up JavaScript framework and templating (Angular2 or React).
* Automate SSL Setup and Renewal.
* Determine if I need shorter CloudFront cache TTLs.
* Automate deployments and CloudFront cache invalidation.
* More content (my work, about me, blog).
* Expand on this README.
